# rsbackup
A simple bash script to automate backups with rsync

DESCRIPTION

rsbackup was written with a simple goal: automate backups on Linux and OSX using rsync and not relying on any other tool. 
It is composed of two main parts:

- rsbackup.sh
It is the actual backup script. 

- rotateBackups.sh
It is the remote script to be hosted on the file server which automates backup rotation.

The structure of the backups generated by rsbackup is as follows:

computername
	|
	backup prefix (e.g. daily, weekly)
		|
		backup folder in yyyymmdd_hhmmss format
			|
			backup files and directories

prefix can be any string chosen by the user and is set by the -p command line parameter.

The number of backups can be configured with the -k (keep) parameter on the command line.
